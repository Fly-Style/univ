Memory Management Simulator
<br>User Guide</h1>

<h2>Purpose</h2>

<p>
This document is a user guide for the MOSS
Memory Management Simulator.  It explains how to use the simulator and
describes the display and the various input files used by and output files
produced by the simulator.  The MOSS software
is designed for use with 
<a href="http://www.cs.vu.nl/~ast/">Andrew S. Tanenbaum</a>, 
<a href="http://vig.prenhall.com/catalog/academic/product/1,4096,0130313580,00.html">Modern Operating Systems, 2nd Edition</a> 
(<a href="http://www.prenhall.com/">Prentice Hall</a>, 2001).  
The Memory Management Simulator was written by 
<a href="http://www.cs.earlham.edu/~odo/">Alex Reeder</a>
(<a href="mailto:alexr@e-sa.org"><i>alexr@e-sa.org</i></a>).  
This user guide was written by 
<a href="http://www.ontko.com/~rayo/">Ray Ontko</a>
(<a href="mailto:rayo@ontko.com"><i>rayo@ontko.com</i></a>).
<p>
This user guide assumes that you have already installed and tested
the simulator.  If you are looking for installation information,
please read the 
<a href="install_unix.html">Installation Guide for 
Unix/Linux/Solaris/HP-UX Systems</a> or the 
<a href="install_windows.html">Installation Guide for 
Win95/98/Me/NT/2000 Systems</a>.
</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
The memory management simulator illustrates page fault behavior 
in a paged virtual memory system. The program reads the initial 
state of the page table and a sequence of virtual memory 
instructions and writes a trace log indicating the effect of each 
instruction. It includes a graphical user interface so that 
students can observe page replacement algorithms at work. Students 
may be asked to implement a particular page replacement algorithm 
which the instructor can test by comparing the output from the 
student's algorithm to that produced by a working implementation. 

</p>

<h2>Running the Simulator</h2>

<p>
The program reads a command file, optionally reads 
a configuration file, displays a GUI window which
allows you to execute the command file, and optionally 
writes a trace file. 
<p>
To run the program, enter the following command line.

<blockquote><pre>
$ java MemoryManagement commands memory.conf
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
The program will display a window allowing you to run the
simulator.  You will notice a row of command buttons across
the top, two columns of "page" buttons at the left, and an
informational display at the right.  
</p>
<IMG SRC="user_guide_1.gif">
<p>
Typically you will
use the <tt>step</tt> button to execute a command from the 
input file, examine information about any pages by clicking
on a <tt>page</tt> button, and when you're done, quit the
simulation using the <tt>exit</tt> button.

<p>
The buttons:
</p>
<table border="1" cellspacing="0">

<h2>The Command File</h2>

<p>
The command file for the simulator specifies a sequence
of memory instructions to be performed.  Each instruction
is either a memory READ or WRITE operation, and includes
a virtual memory address to be read or written.  Depending on whether
the virtual page for the address is present in physical
memory, the operation will succeed, or, if not, a page fault 
will occur.

<h3>Operations on Virtual Memory</h3>

<p>
There are two operations one can carry out on pages in memory: 
READ and WRITE.
<p>
The format for each command is 
<blockquote><pre>
<i>operation</i> <i>address</i>
</pre></blockquote>
or
<blockquote><pre>
<i>operation</i> random
</pre></blockquote>
where <i>operation</i> is <tt>READ</tt> or <tt>WRITE</tt>,
and <i>address</i> is the numeric virtual memory address, optionally
preceeded by one of the radix keywords <tt>bin</tt>, <tt>oct</tt>,
or <tt>hex</tt>.  If no radix is supplied, the number is assumed
to be decimal.
The keyword <tt>random</tt> will generate a random virtual 
memory address 
(for those who want to experiment quickly) 
rather than having to type an address.

<p>
For example, the sequence

<blockquote><pre>
READ bin 01010101
WRITE bin 10101010
READ random
WRITE random
</pre></blockquote>

causes the virtual memory manager to:

<ol>
<li>read from virtual memory address 85
<li>write to virtual memory address 170
<li>read from some random virtual memory address
<li>write to some random virtual memory address
</ol>

<h3>Sample Command File</h3>
<p>
The "commands" input file looks like this:

<blockquote><pre>
// Enter READ/WRITE commands into this file
// READ <OPTIONAL number type: bin/hex/oct> <virtual memory address or random>
// WRITE <OPTIONAL number type: bin/hex/oct> <virtual memory address or random>
READ bin 100
READ 19
WRITE hex CC32
READ bin 100000000000000
READ bin 100000000000000
WRITE bin 110000000000001
WRITE random


</pre></blockquote>

<h2>The Configuration File</h2>

The configuration file <tt>memory.conf</tt> is used to specify the 
the initial content of the virtual memory map 
(which pages of virtual
memory are mapped to which pages in physical memory)
and provide other configuration information, such
as whether operation should be logged to a file.

<h3>Setting Up the Virtual Memory Map</h3>
<p>
The <tt>memset</tt> command is used to initialize each 
entry in the virtual page map.
<tt>memset</tt> is followed by six integer values:

<ol>
<li>The virtual page # to initialize
<li>The physical page # associated with this virtual page 
(-1 if no page assigned)
<li>If the page has been read from (R) (0=no, 1=yes)
<li>If the page has been modified (M) (0=no, 1=yes)
<li>The amount of time the page has been in memory (in ns)
<li>The last time the page has been modified (in ns)
</ol>
The first two parameters define the mapping between
the virtual page and a physical page, if any.
The last four parameters are values that might be used
by a page replacement algorithm.
<p>
For example,

<blockquote><pre>
memset 34 23 0 0 0 0
</pre></blockquote>

specifies that virtual page 34 maps to physical page 23, 
and that the page has not been read or modified.
<p>
Note:
<ul>
<li>Each physical page should be mapped to exactly one virtual page.
<li>The number of virtual pages is fixed at 64 (0..63).
<li>The number of physical pages cannot exceed 64 (0..63).
<li>If a virtual page is not specified by any memset command,
it is assumed that the page is not mapped.
</ul>

<h3>Other Configuration File Options</h3>

<p>There are a number of other options which can 
be specified in the configuration file.  These are
summarized in the table below.
</p>

<table border="1" cellspacing="0">
<tr><th>Keyword<th>Values<th>Description
<tr><td valign="top"><tt>enable_logging</tt><td valign="top"><tt>true</tt><br><tt>false</tt>
<td valign="top">Whether logging of the operations should be enabled.  If logging
is enabled, then the program writes a one-line message for each 
READ or WRITE operation.  By default, no logging is enabled.
See also the <tt>log_file</tt> option.

<tr><td valign="top"><tt>log_file</tt>
<td valign="top"><i>trace-file-name</i>
<td valign="top">The name of the file to which log messages should be written.
If no filename is given, then log messages are written to stdout.
This option has no effect if <tt>enable_logging</tt> is <tt>false</tt>
or not specified.

<tr><td valign="top"><tt>pagesize</tt><td valign="top"><i>n</i><br>
<tt>power</tt> <i>p</i>
<td valign="top">The size of the page in bytes as a power of two.  
This can be given as a decimal number which is a 
power of two (1, 2, 4, 8, etc.) or as a power of two using
the <tt>power</tt> keyword. The maximum page size is 
<tt>67108864</tt> or <tt>power 26</tt>.  The default
page size is <tt>power 26</tt>.

<tr><td valign="top"><tt>addressradix</tt><td valign="top"><i>n</i>
<td valign="top">The radix in which numerical values are displayed.
The default radix is 2 (binary).  You may prefer radix
8 (octal), 10 (decimal), or 16 (hexadecimal).

</pre></blockquote>

<h2>The Output File</h2>

<p>
The output file contains a log of the operations
since the simulation started (or since the last reset).
It lists the command that was attempted and what happened
as a result.  You can review this file after executing
the simulation.
<p>
The output file contains one line per operation
executed.  The format of each line is:
<blockquote><pre>
<i>command</i> <i>address</i> ... <i>status</i>
</pre></blockquote>
where:
<ul type="none">
<li><i>command</i> is <tt>READ</tt> or <tt>WRITE</tt>,
<li><i>address</i> is a number corresponding to a virtual memory address, and 
<li><i>status</i> is <tt>okay</tt> or <tt>page fault</tt>.
</ul>

<h3>Sample Output</h3>
The output "tracefile" looks something like this:

<blockquote><pre>
READ 4 ... okay
READ 13 ... okay
WRITE 3acc32 ... okay
READ 10000000 ... okay
READ 10000000 ... okay
WRITE c0001000 ... page fault
WRITE 2aeea2ef ... okay
</pre></blockquote>


<h2>Suggested Exercises</h2>

<ol>
<li>Create a command file that maps any 8 pages of physical memory to 
the first 8 pages of virtual memory, and then reads from one virtual
memory address on each 
of the 64 virtual pages.  Step through
the simulator one operation at a time and see if you can predict
which virtual memory addresses cause page faults.  What page replacement 
algorithm is being used?
<p><!-- --></p>
<li>Modify <tt>replacePage()</tt> in 
<tt>PageFault.java</tt> to implement a <em>round robin</em>
page replacement algorithm
(i.e., first page fault
replaces page 0, next one replaces page 1, next one replaces page 2, 
etc.).
<p><!-- --></p>
<li>Modify <tt>replacePage()</tt> in 
<tt>PageFault.java</tt> to implement a <em>least recently used</em>
(LRU) page replacement algorithm.
<p><!-- --></p>
</ol>

<h2>To Do</h2>
<ol>
<li>
The user guide should tell a little bit about how replacePage works, e.g.
what data structures it uses, what the arguments are,
how it operates, how it makes it choice known, etc.
Add a section of documentation on how to implement a new 
page replacement algorithm.  This should explain a little about
what changes are needed in the GUI, what to call the page replacement
class, what fields and methods it needs to provide, and what
other changes might be needed.  
</ol>
