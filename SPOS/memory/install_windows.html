<h1>MOSS Memory Management Simulator

<br>Installation on Windows 95/98/Me/NT/2000 Systems</h1>



<h2>Purpose</h2>

<p>
This document provides instructions for the installation
of the MOSS Memory Management Simulator on 

Microsoft Windows 


operating systems.  This procedure should be the same or similar on 

Windows 95, 98, Me, NT, and 2000 


systems.  
The MOSS software
is designed for use with 
<a href="http://www.cs.vu.nl/~ast/">Andrew S. Tanenbaum</a>, 
<a href="http://vig.prenhall.com/catalog/academic/product/1,4096,0130313580,00.html">Modern Operating Systems, 2nd Edition</a> 
(<a href="http://www.prenhall.com/">Prentice Hall</a>, 2001).  
The Memory Management Simulator was written by 
<a href="http://www.cs.earlham.edu/~odo/">Alex Reeder</a>
(<a href="mailto:alexr@e-sa.org"><i>alexr@e-sa.org</i></a>).  
This installation guide was written by 
<a href="http://www.ontko.com/~rayo/">Ray Ontko</a>
(<a href="mailto:rayo@ontko.com"><i>rayo@ontko.com</i></a>).

<p>
This installation guide only provides information about 
installing the software and testing the configuration for 


Windows operating systems.  To install on Unix-like
operating systems, please read the 
<a href="install_unix.html">Installation Guide for Unix/Linux/Solaris/HP-UX Systems</a>.

For more detailed information about the simulator, please
read the <a href="user_guide.html">User Guide</a>.
</p>

<h2>Requirements</h2>

The following software components are required
to install and use the MOSS Memory Management
Simulator.
<ul>

<li>Microsoft Windows 95, 98, Me, NT, or 2000


<li>Java Development Kit (JDK) 1.0 or greater 
<li>Text program editor (e.g., notepad)
</ul>

<h2>Pre-Installation</h2>
<p>
Before installation, you should verify:
</p>
<ul>
<li>that you have a working java runtime environment,
<li>that you have a working java development environment, and 
<li>that the working directory is in the classpath for the runtime environment.
</ul>
<p>
If you're using a standard command-line java compiler, the following
instructions will help determine if your environment is configured
correctly.
</p>
<ol>
<li>Verify that you have java installed and configured in your environment.

<blockquote><pre>
C:\WINDOWS> java -version
</pre></blockquote>


You should see a message like this with possibly a different version number.
<blockquote><pre>
java version "1.1.8"
</pre></blockquote>
If you get a message like:

<blockquote><pre>
Bad command or file name
</pre></blockquote>


Then java may not be installed on your system, or may not be configured
for your use.
<p>
If you think that Java may already be installed on your system 
but may not be in your "path", you can find it by

choosing Start -> Find -> Files or Folders
and enter "java.exe" in the "Named:" field and click the Find Now button.
If found, make note of the directory folder in which it resides (e.g.,
"C:\jdk1.1.8\bin").
<p>
While you're at it, also seach for javac.exe to see if the Java
compiler is installed and whether it's in the same directory as
the java.exe file.


<p>
If Java isn't available on your system, you should check with
your instructor or system administrator.  If you administer your
own system, then you should be able to find a copy of Java
for your operating system.
<p>
If you find that java is installed but not configured for
your use, then perhaps you need to add it to your path.  Consult
your instructor or system administrator if you need help adding this
to your path.
</p>
<p><!-- --></p>

<li>Verify that the java compiler is installed and configured in 
your environment.

<blockquote><pre>
C:\WINDOWS> javac
</pre></blockquote>


If you're using a standard java command-line compiler, you should
see a message similar to this.
<blockquote><pre>
use: javac [-g][-O][-debug][-depend][-nowarn][-verbose][-classpath path][-nowrite][-deprecation][-d dir][-J<runtime flag>] file.java...
</pre></blockquote>
If you get a message like:

<blockquote><pre>
Bad command or file name
</pre></blockquote>


then the java compiler may not be installed on your system, or 
may not be configured for your use.   Consult your instructor
or system administrator.
<p><!-- --></p>

<li>Verify that that the current directory is in your classpath.

<blockquote><pre>
C:\WINDOWS> echo "%CLASSPATH%"
</pre></blockquote>
You should see a list of directories separated by semi-colons (";") 
or possibly just "". If you don't see the directory "." (a single
period, which stands for the current directory), then you should
add it to the classpath.
<blockquote><pre>
C:\WINDOWS> set CLASSPATH=.;%CLASSPATH%
</pre></blockquote>


<p><!-- --></p>

</ol>
<p>
If you have a working java runtime environment, a working java
compiler, and the current directory is in your path, then you're
ready to proceed with the installation.
</p>


<h2>Installation</h2>

Installation of the software can be accomplished with
these simple steps:
<ol>
<li>

Create a directory folder in which you wish to install
the simulator (e.g., "C:\moss\memory").  You can do
this using the Windows explorer, or from the MS-DOS
prompt.  To create the directory from the MS-DOS
prompt:
<blockquote><pre>
C:\WINDOWS> cd \&nbsp;
C:\> mkdir moss
C:\> cd moss
C:\moss> mkdir memory
C:\moss> cd memory
C:\moss\memory>
</pre></blockquote>


<p><!-- --></p>

<li>

Download the self-extracting ZIP archive (memory.exe) into
the directory folder.
The latest release for this file can always be found at
<a href="http://www.ontko.com/moss/memory/memory.exe">http://www.ontko.com/moss/memory/memory.exe</a>.


<p><!-- --></p>

<li>

Double-click on the file you downloaded (memory.exe),
or invoke it using Start -> Run..., or invoke it
from an MS-DOS command prompt:
<blockquote><pre>
C:\moss\memory> memory.exe
</pre></blockquote>


<p><!-- --></p>

</ol>

<h2>Files</h2>
<p>
The directory should now contain the following files:
</p>
<table border="1" cellspacing="0">

<h2>Compilation</h2>

<p>
The distribution includes compiled class files as
well as the source java files.  You should not need
to recompile unless you decide to change the code.
If you wish to compile the code, 
the following commands should work if you're using
a Java compiler that accepts the normal "javac" command
line.

<blockquote><pre>
C:\moss\memory> javac -nowarn *.java
</pre></blockquote>



The <tt>-nowarn</tt> flag supresses warning messges, of which
there may be several.  For backward compatability we use only
those features of Java which have been present from the beginning,
some of which are deprecated and are usually reported by the 
compiler with warning messages.

<h2>Test</h2>

<p>
To test the program, enter the following command line.


<blockquote><pre>
C:\moss\memory> java MemoryManagement commands memory.conf
</pre></blockquote>



<p>
The program will display a window allowing you to run the
simulator.  
When the window presents itself, click on the Run
button.  
You should see the 
program "execute" 7 memory operations, about one per second.
When the simulation completes, click the 
Exit button.
<p>
The memory operation commands are read from a file called 
"commands",
and the initial configuration and various options are 
specified in the file "memory.conf".  
The program also produces a log file called "tracefile"
in the working directory.

<p>
The "commands" file looks something like this:
<blockquote><pre>
// Enter READ/WRITE commands into this file
// READ &lt;OPTIONAL number type: bin/hex/oct&gt; &lt;virtual memory address or random&gt;
// WRITE &lt;OPTIONAL number type: bin/hex/oct&gt; &lt;virtual memory address or random&gt;
READ bin 100
READ 19
WRITE hex CC32
READ bin 10000000000000000
READ bin 10000000000000000
WRITE bin 11000000000000001
WRITE random
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
If things are working correctly, the "tracefile" should look 
something like this:

<blockquote><pre>
READ 4 ... okay
READ 13 ... okay
WRITE 3acc32 ... okay
READ 10000000 ... okay
READ 10000000 ... okay
WRITE c0001000 ... page fault
WRITE 1ff82cdc ... okay
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
The program and its input and output files are described 
more fully in the <i>MOSS Memory Management Simulator
