MOSS
Deadlock Simulator
<br>User Guide</h1>

<h2>Purpose</h2>

<p>
This document is a user guide for the MOSS
Deadlock Simulator.  It explains how to use the simulator and
describes the display and the various input files used by and output files
produced by the simulator.  The MOSS software
is designed for use with 
<a href="http://www.cs.vu.nl/~ast/">Andrew S. Tanenbaum</a>, 
<a href="http://vig.prenhall.com/catalog/academic/product/1,4096,0130313580,00.html">Modern Operating Systems, 2nd Edition</a> 
(<a href="http://www.prenhall.com/">Prentice Hall</a>, 2001).  
The Deadlock Simulator and this user guide were written by 
<a href="http://www.ontko.com/~rayo/">Ray Ontko</a>
(<a href="mailto:rayo@ontko.com"><i>rayo@ontko.com</i></a>).
<p>
This user guide assumes that you have already installed and tested
the simulator.  If you are looking for installation information,
please read the 
<a href="install_unix.html">Installation Guide for 
Unix/Linux/Solaris/HP-UX Systems</a> or the 
<a href="install_windows.html">Installation Guide for 
Win95/98/Me/NT/2000 Systems</a>.
</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
The deadlock simulator illustrates multiple processes competing 
for one or more resources to investigate the nature and causes of 
deadlock conditions and how they can be avoided, detected, and 
resolved. The simulator includes a graphical user interface that 
allows the student to step through the "programs" being 
concurrently "executed" by each of the processes and see which 
processes are blocked by which resources. A typical student lab 
exercise might require students to write simple "programs" for 
the simulator to investigate different kinds of resource 
contention conditions.  More advanced students might write a 
deadlock manager (in Java) based on the template provided, and 
test it using "programs" of their own design. 

</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>
The deadlock simulator performs the following steps
as part of the simulation:

<ul>
<li>It creates a specified number of simulated processes.
<li>For each process, it reads a command file of actions
to be performed by that process.  Each action is one of
the following:
<ul>
<li>compute for a specified length of time
<li>request an instance of a specified resource
<li>free an instance of a specified resource
<li>end or halt the process
</ul>
<li>It creates a specified number of instances for each
of several resources.
<li>It "executes" the simulation by considering the commands
for each process, one at a time, and either allowing the process
to execute, granting it an instance of a requested resource, 
blocking the process until a requested is available, or ending a 
process.
<li>As the execution proceeds, the display is updated to reflect
the status of each process, and the number of available instances
of each resource.
<li>At the end of each cycle of execution, the simulator writes
a "log" message indicating the time since the beginning of the 
simulation, the number of available instances of each resource,
the number of blocked processes, etc.
<li>The user may "step" through the simulation to view the 
action at each cycle, or may "run" the simulation to completion.
<li>When all processes are halted, the simulation stops.
</ul>

<h2>Running the Simulator</h2>

<p>
To run the program, enter the following command line.

<blockquote><pre>
$ java deadlock a 2 1 >a.log
</pre></blockquote>

In this example, 

<dl>
<dt>a
<dd>is the prefix for the names of the files containing the commands,
(the actual names of the files are "a0.dat", and "a1.dat"),
<dt>2
<dd>is the number of processes to be created,
<dt>1
<dd>is the number of instances to create for the first resource, and
<dt>a.log
<dd>is the name of the output file.
</dl>

<p>
The program will display a window allowing you to run the
simulator.  You will notice a row of command buttons across
the top, and an informational display below.  The left side
of the information display lists the resources and the
number of available instances for each, and the 
right side lists the processes and the current status for each.
</p>
<IMG SRC="user_guide_1.gif">
<p>
Typically you will
use the <tt>step</tt> button to execute a cycle of the simulation
and observe the effect on the resources and processes.
When you're done, quit the simulation using the <tt>exit</tt> button.

<h3>The Command Line</h3>

<p>
The general form of the command line is
</p>
<blockquote>
$ java deadlock <i>file-name-prefix</i> <i>initial-number-of-processes</i>
<i>initial-available-for-resource</i> ...
</blockquote>
<p>
where
</p>
<table border="1" cellspacing="0">
<tr><th>Parameter
<th>Description</th>
<tr>
<td valign="top"><i>file-name-prefix
<td>Specifies the name prefix for the process command files.
The default command file names are generated from this prefix,
followed by the number of the process, followed by ".dat"
(e.g, "a0.dat", "a1.dat" if "a" is the prefix).
The actual names of the files
may be entered or modified in the Processes Dialog (see below).
<tr>
<td valign="top"><i>initial-number-of-processes
<td>Specifies the number of processes to create for the simulation.
This should be a non-negative number, usually greater than one.
This number may also be entered or modified using 
the Options Dialog (see below).
<tr>
<td valign="top"><i>initial-available-for-resource</i>...
<td>Specifies the initial number of instances available for each
resource.  This should be a sequence of non-negative numbers.
For example, "2 1 2 0" indicates that there are four resources,
and there are initially two instances of resource 0, one instance
of resource 1, two instances of resource 2, and zero instances 
of resource 3.  The <em>number</em> of resources may also 
be entered or modified using the Options Dialog (see below).
The initial number of instances <em>available</em> for each
resource may be entered or modified using the Resources Dialog 
(see below).

<h3>The Control Panel</h3>

<p>
The main control panel for the simulator includes a row of 
command buttons, and an informational display. 
</p>

<IMG SRC="user_guide_1.gif">
<p>
The buttons:
</p>
<table border="1" cellspacing="0">
<tr><th>Button
<th>Description</th>
<tr><td valign="top"><tt>run</tt>
<td valign="top">runs the simulation to completion.  Note that the simulation
pauses and updates the screen between each step.
<tr><td valign="top"><tt>stop</tt>
<td valign="top">stops the simulation if it is running.  This button is only
active if the run button has been pressed.
<tr><td valign="top"><tt>step</tt>
<td valign="top">runs a single setup of the simulation and updates the display.
<tr><td valign="top"><tt>reset</tt>
<td valign="top">initializes the simulator and starts from the initial values
for each process and resource.
<tr><td valign="top"><tt>options</tt>
<td valign="top">allows you to change various options for the simulator, 
including the number of resources and the number of processes.
<tr><td valign="top"><tt>resources</tt>
<td valign="top">allows you to change the configuration for each resource,
including the initial and current number of instances available for each
resource.
<tr><td valign="top"><tt>processes</tt>
<td valign="top">allows you to change the configuration for each process,
including current state and the name of the command file for that process.

The informational display:
</p>
<table border="1" cellspacing="0">
<tr><th>Field
<th>Description</th>
<tr><td valign="top"><tt>Time:</tt>
<td valign="top">number of "milliseconds" since the start of the simulation.
<tr><td valign="top"><tt>Resource Id:</tt>
<td valign="top">A number which identifies the particular resource.  
Resources are numbered starting with zero.

<td valign="top">The current state of the process.  This may be U (unknown), 
C (computable), W (waiting), or H (halted).  At the beginning of the simulation,
all processes have U status.  While a process is computable, it has a C status.
If it requests a resource which is unavailable, it enters W status until
the resource becomes available. When a process has completed all the commands
in its command file or performs a halt command, it enters H status.
<tr><td valign="top"><tt>Process Resource:</tt>
<td valign="top">The resource for which this process is waiting, if any.
This field only has a value if the process is in W status.
</table>

<h3>The Options Dialog Box</h3>

<p>
The Options Dialog Box allows you to set general options for
the simulator.
</p>
<IMG SRC="user_guide_2.gif">
<p>
The options:
</p>
<table border="1" cellspacing="0">
<tr><th>Field
<th>Description</th>
<tr>
<td valign="top"><tt>Number of Processes:</tt>
<td valign="top">The number of processes to use in the simulation.
This should be a non-negative number, usually at least two. 
Although
the program does not enforce a limit, you may not be able to view more
than about 10 processes on the informational display on your display screen.
The initial value for this option is obtained from the second parameter
on the command line, or zero, if not specified.
Keep in mind that each process should have a process command file.  
To set properties for individual processes, use the Processes Dialog 
(see below).
<tr>
<td valign="top"><tt>Number of Resources:</tt>
<td valign="top">The number of resources available in the simulation.
This should be a non-negative number, usually at least one.  Although
the program does not enforce a limit, you may not be able to view more than
about 10 resources on the informational display on your display screen.  
The initial value for this option is obtained
from the number of initial instances for each resource specified on
the command line (see above), or zero, if none are specified.  This
number should be one more than the largest resource number mentioned
in any of the process command files for the simulation.
To set properties for individual resources, use the Resources Dialog
(see below).
<tr>
<td valign="top"><tt>Milliseconds per step:</tt>
<td valign="top">The number of real-time milliseconds to pause between each 
cycle of the simulator in "run" mode.  This is the pause between cycles
when you hit the run button.  The default value is 1000 milliseconds, or,
one second.
</table>

<h3>The Processes Dialog Box</h3>

starting with zero.  These numbers cannot be changed.
<tr>
<td valign="top"><tt>Process File Name</tt>
<td valign="top">The name of the file from which process commands
are read.  This may be any valid filename.
For convenience, there is a choose button which allows you to browse
the file system to choose the file.  By default, the name is the 
prefix string, followed by the process number, followed by ".dat".
</table>

<h3>The Resources Dialog Box</h3>

<p>
The Resources Dialog Box allows you to enter and modify properties
for each resource.
</p>
<IMG SRC="user_guide_3.gif">

may have on processes waiting for the resource.
</table>

<h2>The Process Command Files</h2>

<p>
The process command files for the simulator specifies a sequence
operations to be performed by the process or processes which use
the file.  There are four operations defined C (compute), 
R (request resource), F (free resource) and H (halt).

<table border="1" cellspacing="0">
<tr>
<th>Operation</th>
<th>Description</th>
<tr>
<td valign="top"><tt>C</tt> <i>msec</i></td>
<td valign="top">Compute for the specified number of milliseconds (cycles).
<tr>
<td valign="top"><tt>R</tt> <i>resource-id</i></td>
<td valign="top">Request an instance of the specified resource.  If none 
are available, block the process until the resource becomes available.
The resource id should be a non-negative number <em>less than</em> 
the total number of resources available.
<tr>
<td valign="top"><tt>F</tt> <i>resource-id</i></td>
<td valign="top">Free an instance of the specified resource.
This is usually a resource that was previously requested by
the process.
The resource id should be a non-negative number <em>less than</em>
the total number of resources available.
<tr>
<td valign="top"><tt>H</tt></td>
<td valign="top">Halt the process.  This is usually the last
operation in the file.  Any commands which follow it in the file
are ignored. Any file that does not end with this operation is
implicitly halted.
</table>

<h3>Sample Process Command Files</h3>
<p>
The "a0.dat" input file looks like this:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
/*
a0.dat

The "a" collection of process data files is meant to simulate
two processes competing for a single resource.  If you run
the simulator with one resource available, one of the processes
will block until the other is done using the resource.
*/
C 10    // compute for 10 milliseconds
R 0     // request resource 0
C 10    // compute for 10 milliseconds
F 0     // free resource 0
H       // halt process

</pre></blockquote>

<p>
Note that the "a1.dat" file is identical.  In other words, both
files request the same resources at approximately the same time.
</p>

<h2>The Output File</h2>

<p>
The output file contains a log of the simulation
since the simulation started.
<p>
The output file contains one line per cycle
executed.  The format of each line is:
<blockquote><pre>
time = <i>t</i> available = <i>r<sub>0</sub></i> <i>r<sub>1</sub></i> ... <i>r<sub>n</sub></i> blocked = <i>n</i>
</pre></blockquote>
where
<dl>
<dt><i>t</i>
<dd>is the number of milliseconds since the start of the simulation,
<dt><i>r<sub>i</sub></i>
<dd>is the number of available instances of each resource, and
<dt><i>n</i>
<dd>is the number of blocked processes.
</dl>
<h3>Sample Output</h3>

<p>
The output file "a.log" looks something like this:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
time = 0 available = 1 blocked = 0
time = 1 available = 1 blocked = 0
time = 2 available = 1 blocked = 0
time = 3 available = 1 blocked = 0
time = 4 available = 1 blocked = 0
time = 5 available = 1 blocked = 0
time = 6 available = 1 blocked = 0
time = 7 available = 1 blocked = 0
time = 8 available = 1 blocked = 0
time = 9 available = 1 blocked = 0
time = 10 available = 0 blocked = 1
time = 11 available = 0 blocked = 1
time = 12 available = 0 blocked = 1
time = 13 available = 0 blocked = 1
time = 14 available = 0 blocked = 1
time = 15 available = 0 blocked = 1
time = 16 available = 0 blocked = 1
time = 17 available = 0 blocked = 1
time = 18 available = 0 blocked = 1
time = 19 available = 0 blocked = 1
time = 20 available = 0 blocked = 0
time = 21 available = 0 blocked = 0
time = 22 available = 0 blocked = 0
time = 23 available = 0 blocked = 0
time = 24 available = 0 blocked = 0
time = 25 available = 0 blocked = 0
time = 26 available = 0 blocked = 0
time = 27 available = 0 blocked = 0
time = 28 available = 0 blocked = 0
time = 29 available = 0 blocked = 0
time = 30 available = 1 blocked = 0

</pre></blockquote>
<p>
In this example, the simulation runs for a total of 30 "milliseconds"
and then halts.  During the simulation, all processes are computable
for 10 milliseconds. During the next 10 milliseconds, 
the one instance of the resource is allocated
to one process, while the other process is blocked.  During the
final 10 milliseconds, the first process frees the resource,
but it is immediately allocated by the second process, which 
then continues to compute, unblocked, to the end of the simulation.
</p>

<h2>Suggested Exercises</h2>

<ol>
<li>Try running the deadlock simulator using the following command:
<blockquote><pre>
java deadlock a 2 2
</pre></blockquote>
Explain why a deadlock does <em>not</em> occur.
<p><!-- --></p>

<li>There are two additional process command files ("b0.dat" and 
"b1.dat") in the distribution.  Run the deadlock simulator with 
this command:
<blockquote><pre>
java deadlock b 2 1 1
</pre></blockquote>
What happens?
<p>
Now try this.
<blockquote><pre>
java deadlock b 2 1 2
</pre></blockquote>
Why does the first command result in a deadlock but the 
second does not?   
Explain your answer in terms of what is going on in the process 
command files, b0.dat and b1.dat.
<p><!-- --></p>
<!--
<li>Modify the deadlocked() method of DeadlockManager.java to
handle the case where all processes are deadlocked and one must
be terminated and its resources freed.
-->
</ol>

<h2>To Do</h2>
<ol>
<li>New snapshots of each panel.  The current ones are out of date
and they have garish colors.

<li>A better strategy for handling error messages.  There are a few
places where it would be better to post an alert message if the
user enters an invalid value.  Currently, we only write a message
to stdout.

<li>The close button on the window does not seem to work under Windows.

<li>If the number of processes or resources is changed, the panel
should resize itself.

<li>If the number of processes or resources is large (~>10), then the 
display does not fit within the window or screen.  This should 
cause a scroll-bar to appear.

<li>allow the filename prefix and suffix to be specified in the 
options dialog.

<li>Needs to be runnable without a display.  This would need to
achieve the same effect as clicking the run button and then the 
exit button at the end of the simulation, but NOT creating the
window and buttons or any other component of the graphical display.
This may take a fair amount of rework.
</ol>
