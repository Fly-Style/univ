The scheduling simulator illustrates the behavior of scheduling 
algorithms against a simulated mix of process loads. The user can 
specify the number of processes, the mean and standard deviation 
for compute time and I/O blocking time for each process, and the 
duration of the simulation. At the end of the simulation a 
statistical summary is presented. Students may also be asked to 
write their own scheduling algorithms to be used with process 
loads defined by the instructor.
